# 🧠 Personal Assistant LLM

This project aims to build a **lightweight, local-first Large Language Model (LLM)**–powered assistant that can respond intelligently using **user-provided data**.  
Think of it as your own **context-aware personal assistant** — one that learns from the documents you give it.

At its core, it connects to a **ChromaDB (Cloud)** instance, allowing document storage, vector embeddings, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) queries.

## ⚙️ Current Functionality

✅ Connected to **ChromaDB (Cloud)**  
✅ CLI interface allows prompting via terminal — queries are sent to ChromaDB and responses are generated  
✅ Supports **document upload and storage** within ChromaDB for contextual responses

## 🧩 Next Step: Frontend Development

The upcoming milestone is to build a **web-based frontend** that enables users to:
- Upload documents directly through the browser  
- Ask questions and view answers in real-time  
- Display stored documents and query history  

This interface will bridge the backend and provide a simple way to interact with the assistant visually.
