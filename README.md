# 🧠 Personal Assistant LLM

This project delivers a **lightweight, Gemini wrapper - Large Language Model (LLM)**–powered assistant that responds intelligently using **user-provided data**.  
It functions as a **personal knowledge assistant**, capable of learning from and reasoning over the documents you upload.

The system is fully integrated with **ChromaDB (Cloud)** for document storage, vector embeddings, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) queries — now complete with a functional frontend and live deployment.

---

## ⚙️ Current Functionality

✅ Connected to **ChromaDB (Cloud)**  
✅ CLI interface for terminal-based queries — prompts are sent to ChromaDB, and responses are returned intelligently  
✅ Supports **document upload and storage** within ChromaDB for contextual responses  
✅ **Frontend implemented** — users can now chat directly with the bot through a web interface  
✅ **File upload via browser** — users can upload new articles/files that are stored in the database and used to improve the assistant’s knowledge  
✅ **Deployed live** — available directly on the developer’s webpage

## 🌐 Live Deployment

The full project is live and accessible through the developer’s personal website.  
The assistant can be chatted with directly, and new articles can be uploaded to expand its knowledge base.

## 🚀 Project Status

✅ **Project finalized and fully functional**  
✅ **Chat** with the bot via the browser  
✅ **Upload new articles/files** directly through the frontend  
✅ **ChromaDB integration** complete  
✅ **Live deployment** on personal webpage  

The system now represents a full end-to-end LLM assistant pipeline — from user input and document ingestion to contextual response generation and real-time interaction.

- Next step is to add MCP functionality to the project
